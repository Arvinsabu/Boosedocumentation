# Generative AI Log

Tool Used: ChatGPT (GPT-5)
Purpose: Generated a ready-to-run C# Visual Studio solution skeleton and example code for checkpoint.
Usage Summary:

* Created WinForms app with boose (moveto/drawto/circle/rect/pencolour/write).
* Added NUnit test project with three tests.
* I needed a clear example of what a proper AI log looks like so I can

include it in my assignment and show how I used AI during development.



I confirm AI tools were used to assemble and generate this project skeleton for checkpoint use.
