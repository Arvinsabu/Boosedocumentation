# Generative AI Log

Tool Used: ChatGPT (GPT-5)
Purpose: Generated a ready-to-run C# Visual Studio solution skeleton and example code for checkpoint.
Usage Summary:

* Created WinForms app with boose (moveto/drawto/circle/rect/pencolour/write).
* Added NUnit test project with three tests.
* I needed a clear example of what a proper AI log looks like so I can
* I needed to document my AI usage for my assignment and show that I used
AI appropriately to support my learning.
*I needed clarification about how my interpreter processes commands
(moveto, drawto, circle, rectangle, etc.) and how to properly document
my AI usage for assessment.

include it in my assignment and show how I used AI during development.



I confirm AI tools were used to assemble and generate this project skeleton for checkpoint use.
